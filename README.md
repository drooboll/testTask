# This repository contains files of test program for 2GIS.
There are two solutions:
- Complex one
- Simple one.

Complex one is more OOP-like, it features are described below:
- Simple addition of *Workers*, like existing *Counter*, *Hasher* or *Helper*.
- Simple modification of flags (info concentrated in one class / object).
- Various checksum algorithm (simple sum, xor and crc32 (output is equal to POSIX's chksum)).

Simple one is just simple :)
It has no additional to task features.
